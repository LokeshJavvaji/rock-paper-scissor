To create a Rock Paper Scissors game using both Python and web technologies, you can build a web application that allows users to play the game in a browser interface. Here's a description of how you can combine Python and web technologies to implement the game:

1. Backend with Python:
   - Use a web framework like Flask or Django to build the backend of the application in Python.
   - Define routes and handlers to handle user requests and responses.
   - Implement the game logic using Python, similar to the previous description.

2. Frontend with Web Technologies:
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface of the game.
   - Design an interactive webpage where users can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the result.
   - Utilize JavaScript to send the user's choice to the backend and receive the result from the server.

By combining Python and web technologies, you create an interactive web-based Rock Paper Scissors game where users can play directly in their browser. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface. This allows users to access and enjoy the game .
